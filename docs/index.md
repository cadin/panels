# Build interactive comics for Playdate

<!--<img src="./assets/images/PanelsLoop.gif" width="800px"style="image-rendering: pixelated; margin:0 auto; text-align: center;"/> -->

Provide Panels with a Lua table that describes the sequences in your comic (scroll direction, panel sizes, text, animation and effects) along with your layered graphics. Panels will handle layout, scrolling, animation, and even chapter navigation for you.

Comics built with Panels can support these features:

-   layered, parallax scrolling
-   nested panels
-   sequences with different scroll directions
-   manual (crank) scrolling and auto advancing (panel-by-panel)
-   panel effects like shake and blink
-   animated transitions between sequences
-   animations and transitions within panels based on scroll position
-   animated text layers
-   background audio
-   sound effects triggered by scroll or synced to animations
-   panels with fully custom render functions
-   branching "choose-your-own-adventure" storylines
